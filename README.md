## Project overview

* The project required mastering a different language - React! Pages were broken into components and style remains king.

* My website and its pages are a work-in-progress. As I continue my knowledge past bootcamp, I intend to add/remove/replace projects depending on the job posting.

## Additional learnings

* React is unforgiving if components are not imported correctly or file sources are incorrect. I do appreciate the debugging react provides in comparison to other languages - there's typically error handling available on the browser if page won't load.

* Despite multiple tries, tutoring and TA assistance, my react portfolio does not automatically load. The pages appear after clicking on links. Any advice appreciated! I will continue to debug before demo day.
