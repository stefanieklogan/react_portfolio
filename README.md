## Project overview

* The project is the start of something new! I took this homework assignment as a challenge to build a real portfolio I intend to include on technology-focused resumes moving forward. I intend for the pages to be a resource for employers to get to know my work and probe me for more answers during interviews.

* My website and its pages are a work-in-progress. As I continue my bootcamp journey, I intend to add/remove/replace projects depending on the job posting.

## About Me

* The 'About Me' page takes on new skills including:
    * Page layouts
    * Responsive view
    * Bootstrap content
    * Shorter CSS file
    * Rows & Columns
    * Google fonts

* I also coded links with p-tags and played with hover/focus/active styling for mouse behaviors.

* I still find myself toying with margins, widths. Once I built all the pages, I went back and added styling from Bootstrap and removed code from CSS.

* The background-color for this page was also a journey - I enjoyed the trial & error to figure out what element controlled the background-color for several different areas on the page.

## Portfolio

* I learned a lot from image sizing. None of the images rendered well from the beginning. Trial & error to get to the final product that was responsive and still asthetically pleasing.

* I taught myself how to embed a website into an image. I also taught myself how to add a border to a photo and include into one class for multiple images.

* It's important to ensure you've closed all your div tags. My container was too long & my footer was too narrow. Two days and two missing div tags later I am now in better shape.

## Contact

* I have a feeling forms & I are going to be friends. I'm used to building them in MS Access as well as other applications. This page, while not content rich, came together readily quickly. I'm looking forward to the backend storage of form data later on. #formsarecool

## Additional learnings

* I was able to delete a repo via GitHub after realizing I spelled the folder name incorrectly. That led me to deleting the local folder associated with it via console. My computer would not let me delete the folder the "old fashioned way" and I appreciated the 'forced' learning. I was happy with the outcome.

* I'm proud of the progress I've made in a short week re creating a readme file for a site. I feel more confident in how to host images, write a bulleted list and provide a TOC for every file. I have also incorporated BCS feedback from my code refractor project into this assignment.

* Lastly, my code refractor homework was 46% CSS. In my responsive portfolio work, CSS made up less than 6% of the code used. I think that's a good story for the power of Bootstrap.
